## Features

### Three Amplifiers

Three distinct amplifier channels, each with its own sonic character. From bright and articulate to warm and fat, switch between them instantly. Bass, Mid, Treble, and Presence controls on every amp let you dial in exactly what you need. Configurable noise gate keeps your signal tight and controlled.

### Pre-EQ & Pre-Pedals

Providing incredible dynamic control to condition your signal before the amplifier section.

**9-Band Graphic EQ:** Shape your tone before it hits the amp. Carve out mud, brighten the highs, or sculpt the perfect foundation for your sound.

**Drive Pedal:** Add warmth, grit, and saturation. Push your tone into natural breakup or dial in aggressive distortion. Complete control over character and intensity.

### Post-EQ & Post-Pedals

Fine-tune your sound after the amp with another full 9-band graphic equalizer. Polish problem frequencies. Perfect your tone.

**Stereo Chorus:** Lush and swirly goodness with minimal tweaking. Add width and dimension to your signal.

**Delay:** Three modes—ping pong, wide, normal—and three types: diffusion, vintage digital, modern. Layer your tone with space and atmosphere.

### The Multivoicer

Add four pitch-shifted voices to your signal. Create rich, layered harmonies that sound like a full band. Each voice can be tuned independently from ±24 semitones with cent-level precision.

**Harmonizer Mode:** Automatically generate perfect musical intervals. Choose your root note and scale. Watch your guitar turn into a choir of harmonized voices.

**Vocoder Mode with Formant Shifting:** Add synthetic, vocal-like texture. Push your sound into experimental, otherworldly territory. Create tones impossible with traditional harmonizers.

**Latency-Compensated Dry Signal:** Your original guitar stays perfectly phase-aligned with every harmony voice. Zero issues. Pure tone. Effortless blend.

### Transpose & Doubler

**Transpose:** Pitch your guitar up or down by a constant interval without retuning your instrument. Change tunings instantly.

**Doubler:** Project your signal into a simulated stereo field. Create the sound of a double-tracked recording. Add instant width and fullness to any tone.

### Tuner & Standalone

Built-in live tuner for quick reference. Run Aethis standalone without a DAW. Plug in and play.
