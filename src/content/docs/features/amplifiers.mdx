  controls={[
    { name: "Input Gain", range: "-12 to +12 dB", description: "Adjusts signal level going into the amp" },
    { name: "Output Gain", range: "-12 to +12 dB", description: "Controls the final output level of the amp" }
  ]}
  columns={1}
/>

<ControlCard
  title="Tone Stack (3-Band EQ)"
  color="#FFD97B"
  controls={[

</div>

### Noise Gate

Built-in precision gate to eliminate unwanted hum and buzz during silent passages.

<ControlCard
  title="Gate Controls"
  color="#8B5CF6"
  controls={[
    { name: "Threshold", range: "-80 to 0 dB", description: "Signal level below which the gate closes" },
    { name: "Attack", range: "0.1-100 ms", description: "How quickly the gate opens when signal is detected" },
    { name: "Release", range: "10-1000 ms", description: "How slowly the gate closes after signal stops" },
    { name: "Hold", range: "0-500 ms", description: "Minimum time gate stays open after triggering" }
  ]}
/>

### Compressor

Smooth dynamics control for consistent levels and sustain.

<ControlCard
  title="Compressor Controls"
  color="#F97316"
  controls={[
    { name: "Threshold", range: "-60 to 0 dB", description: "Level above which compression begins" },
    { name: "Ratio", range: "1:1 to 20:1", description: "Amount of gain reduction applied" },
    { name: "Attack", range: "0.1-100 ms", description: "How quickly compression engages" },
    { name: "Release", range: "10-1000 ms", description: "How slowly compression releases" },
    { name: "Makeup Gain", range: "0-24 dB", description: "Compensate for volume lost during compression" },
    { name: "Mix", range: "0-100%", description: "Parallel compression blend for punch with dynamics" }
  ]}
/>

### Drive

Warm, tube-style overdrive for everything from subtle grit to saturated crunch.

<ControlCard
  title="Drive Controls"
  color="#F59E0B"
  controls={[
    { name: "Drive", range: "0-100%", description: "Intensity of the distortion" },
    { name: "Tone", range: "0-100%", description: "Brightness of the overdrive (dark to bright)" },
    { name: "Level", range: "-12 to +12 dB", description: "Output volume compensation" }
  ]}
